      Here you'll find some of the cool ideas I've tried to implement. These are
      primarily personal side projects that involve a concept or technology I
      wanted to get my hands dirty with, but in the future these might include
      some research projects, full-blown applications, and some more blog-style
      entries. I try to include a little bit of a write up with each project, so
      please click on the card to see the deets. I hope you might find these
      interesting or useful in some way! If you have any questions or feedback,
      please feel free to reach out to me via any of the channels on this site.
