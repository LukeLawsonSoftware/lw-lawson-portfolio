    "aboutMe" : [
        "I am currently based in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I am working as a Platform Engineer at Investec. I am also currently completing my BScHons in Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I really like to do a bit of everything, so I sometimes jokingly call myself a 'miscallaneous engineer'.",
        "In my spare time, I love to get distracted by a side project, go down the rabbit hole with a new idea, or do the odd hackathon. In the real world outside of tech, I am an avid rugby fan - go Lions! I also love to travel to world and visit new places. I have been to 10 countries so far, and I am always keen to visit another! I enjoy reading as well - primarily non-fiction books."
